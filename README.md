Project Description

An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. ‚Äù With this paper, we aim to feel the pulse of the E commerce market. What we generally find in the reviews section of these websites is rather deceptive. The star rating of the user is not always concordant with what he/she has written. Also there is no feature wise review available for products. We aim to bridge this gap with our project, make the customers absolutely sure with what they are buying and hence make the E commerce market more user friendly.

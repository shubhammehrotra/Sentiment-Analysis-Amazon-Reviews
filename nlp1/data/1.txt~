check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do
 thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey
 camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting
 camera is truely superb
 shooters in low light should either select the iso manually and/or make sure that they don't shake much, as the camera's chip goes for detail over smoothness
 did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down
 can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking
 I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly
 a high speed/sports mode is something I'll never understand in a camera of this caliber and price
 works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken
 have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it
 640x480 have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card)
 Camera can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with
 disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can
 would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature
 if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera
 camera is bulletproof
 appears that actual owners of this camera all rate it at a 9 or 10 except for those others who are certainly entitled to their opinions
 I love it! It's a definite 10! start up is so quick � can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on
just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)
 connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)
even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still) the camera on while pressing the button (or is it the menu button? i have to check again =)) and it'l show you the time and date
 if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally
 just thought it's cute and cool =) battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times
the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal
 can't help but play with the camera always) sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera
 highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures
 such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =) forgot to mention about the camera's design
 made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer
 bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money
 automatic you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen
 in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price
 camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat
 take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice
 still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy
 much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt
 would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care
 my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment
 knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken
 read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera
 tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing
 size of the camera is perfect
 I was initially looking for a camera I thought that picture quality was my number one priority, however picture quality aint worth nothin if you leave the camera at home
 i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere
 was no compromise this little camera does amazing things
 you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community
com/user/mbs60099 be happy to talk to anyone about this camera
 will not be dissapointed! camera[+2],movie camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot
 only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great
 any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen
 thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera
 apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go
 it turns out, this is an awesome camera! you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up! CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves
 line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck! don't know why CNET says there is a problem with focus, I have all my pictures sharp and high quality
 you don't care about manual controls then its for you! good "every day" camera
 you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you! for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera
 am so glad I bought this camera
 you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500
 is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used
 many other compact PS cameras this camera has an AF assist lamp essential for focusing in dark areas
 also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot
 be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight
 the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive
 Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good)
 have see impressive pictures of this camera but also some who are not as detailed as of the Ixus SD500
 me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed
 found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well)
2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results
 out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web
 unfortunately is greatly underrating this camera in its editorial review
 highly recommend this camera! I can shoot continuous 640x480 60 fps video until my 1gig SD card fills up! am impressed with this camera inside and out
 love the camera
 camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation
 camera responce is VERY quick
 have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face
 A++!!! thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites
 LCD screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones
